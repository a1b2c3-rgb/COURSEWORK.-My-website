    <h1>Building a Personal Finance Tracker</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on March 22, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>           
      I chose to address a real-world issue—personal financial management—for one of my portfolio projects. <br>
      My goal was to create a straightforward yet effective financial tracker <br>
      that would assist users in maintaining control over their earnings and outlays.<br>

    </p>

    <h2>How I Built It</h2>
    <p>
      I utilized JavaScript to manage user input, balance updates, <br>
      and integrate local data, plus HTML and CSS to organize and style the application.<br>
      Because all information is stored locally in the browser, users can access it without logging in.<br>

    </p>

    <h2>Extra Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transaction filtering by category and date</li>
      <li>Chart.js integration to visualize spending</li>
      <li>Dark mode toggle with theme memory</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      I learned how to manage user mistakes, work with local storage efficiently, <br>
      and deconstruct a larger feature into smaller parts from this project. <br>
       I also used a charting library for the first time, which was a really educational experience!<br>
