    <h1>My Journey into Web Development</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on March 15, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>
     My interest in web development began with a lot of Google searches and curiosity. 
     Up until I learned about HTML and CSS, I had always loved solving problems and designing creatively, 
      but I had no idea how they might coexist.

    <p>
      The initial days were difficult. 
       I can still recall spending hours attempting to center a div and wondering why my layout didn't resemble the one in the instruction. 
       However, such hardships added to the satisfaction of every victory.

    <h2>My First Wins</h2>
    <p>
      Even though it was simple, making my first working website was a turning point in my life. 
      I gained knowledge about content organization, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity.

    </p>

    <h2>What Kept Me Going</h2>
    <p>
      My interest was fueled by online tutorials, community support, and my developing self-confidence. 
      I gradually began working on actual projects and gained more knowledge about accessibility and responsive design.

    <p>
      I am currently working on more complex projects, such as full-stack apps, 
      and coaching those who are just beginning their own coding careers.
