    <h1>Top 5 VS Code Extensions for Developers</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on April 2, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>  
      With the correct add-ons, Visual Studio Code, <br>
      which is already a fantastic code editorâ€”becomes a real productivity powerhouse. <br>
      These are the top 5 Visual Studio Code extensions that I <br>
      use to develop code that is clearer, quicker, and more effective.<br>

    </p>

    <h2>1. Prettier</h2>
    <p>
      automatically prepares your code according to standard style guidelines.<br>  
      An essential tool for both personal and group work.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Live Server</h2>
    <p>
      Preview changes to HTML and CSS in the browser instantly.<br>
      greatly saves time when developing a website.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>3. GitLens</h2>
    <p>Git in VS Code is enhanced with the ability to compare <br>
      file versions, check commit history, and see who last touched a line.<br>

    </p>

    <h2>4. JavaScript (ES6) Snippets</h2>
    <p>
      Type less and accomplish more. Shortcuts for common JS functions <br>
      and structures that are useful in boilerplate.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>5. IntelliSense for CSS class names</h2>
    <p>
      Ideal when utilizing utility-first frameworks such as Tailwind CSS. <br>
      Class names are auto-completed while you type.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b></b>Bonus advice:</b> <br>
      don't overdo your extensions. <br>
      Installing too many can cause your editor to lag. <br>
      Only install the ones you actually use!<br>
