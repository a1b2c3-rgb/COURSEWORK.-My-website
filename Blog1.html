    <h1>My Journey into Web Development</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on March 15, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>
      My journey into web development started with curiosity and a lot of Google searches. I had always loved problem-solving and creative design, but I didn’t know how they could come together — until I discovered HTML and CSS.

    <p>
      The early days were rough. I remember spending hours trying to center a div and wondering why my layout didn’t look like the tutorial. But those struggles made every success feel that much more rewarding.

    <h2>My First Wins</h2>
    <p>
      Creating my first functional website — even if it looked basic — was a turning point. I learned how to structure content, style it with CSS, and even add some interactivity using JavaScript.

    <h2>What Kept Me Going</h2>
    <p>
      Community support, online tutorials, and my growing confidence fueled my passion. Over time, I started building real-world projects and learning more about responsive design and accessibility.

      Today, I’m working on more advanced projects, including full-stack apps, and mentoring others just starting their own coding journeys.
