    <h1>Top 5 VS Code Extensions for Developers</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on April 2, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>
      Visual Studio Code is already an amazing code editor, but with the right extensions, it becomes a true productivity powerhouse. 
     Here are my top 5 favorite VS Code extensions that help me write cleaner, faster, and more efficient code.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Prettier</h2>
    <p>
      Automatically formats your code to follow consistent style rules. A must-have for team projects and personal work alike.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Live Server</h2>
    <p>
      Instantly preview HTML and CSS changes in the browser. Saves tons of time during web development.
    </p>

    <h2>3. GitLens</h2>
    <p>
      Supercharges Git in VS Code — see who last touched a line, view commit history, and compare file versions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. JavaScript (ES6) Snippets</h2>
    <p>
      Type less, do more. Useful boilerplate shortcuts for common JS functions and structures.
    </p>

    <h2>5. IntelliSense for CSS class names</h2>
    <p>
      Perfect if you're using utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS. It auto-completes class names as you type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bonus tip: keep your extensions lean. Only install what you truly use — too many can slow your editor down!
