    <h1>5 Tips for Staying Productive as a Student Developer</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on April 6, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>
      Balancing schoolwork, coding projects, and a social life can be tough. Here are five productivity hacks I personally use to stay focused and get things done without burning out.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use the Pomodoro Technique</h2>
    <p>
      Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It helps keep your mind fresh and avoids fatigue.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Set Realistic Daily Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Keep a to-do list of 3-5 key tasks you must complete each day. This builds consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Limit Social Media</h2>
    <p>
      Use app blockers or set specific "scroll time" so you don‚Äôt waste hours on TikTok or Instagram.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Learn to Say No</h2>
    <p>
      Don‚Äôt overcommit. Prioritize what matters for your growth and career.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Review Your Week</h2>
    <p>
      Every Sunday, look back at what you achieved, what didn‚Äôt work, and what you want to improve. It keeps your vision clear.
    </p>

      üí° *Remember: productivity is a skill. The more you practice it, the better you get!*
