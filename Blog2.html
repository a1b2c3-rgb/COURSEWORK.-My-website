    <h1>Building a Personal Finance Tracker</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on March 22, 2025 by Violet Talemwa</em></p>

    <p>
      For one of my portfolio projects, I decided to tackle a real-world problem: managing personal finances. I wanted to build a simple yet powerful finance tracker that helps users stay in control of their income and expenses.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Built It</h2>
    <p>
      I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the app, and JavaScript to handle user input, balance updates, and local storage integration. All data is saved locally in the browser, so users can revisit their info without logging in.
    </p>

    <h2>Extra Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transaction filtering by category and date</li>
      <li>Chart.js integration to visualize spending</li>
      <li>Dark mode toggle with theme memory</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      This project taught me how to work with local storage effectively, handle user errors, and break a larger feature into smaller steps. It was also my first time using a charting library â€” a great learning experience!
